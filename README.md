# Claude with Tree of Thought (ToT) Implementation

A Python implementation that leverages Claude's language capabilities combined with the Tree of Thought technique to solve complex analytical problems. This project demonstrates how GenAI can analyze multi-faceted questions by breaking them down into branches and sub-branches for comprehensive evaluation.

## üìã Project Overview

This program implements the Tree of Thought technique with Claude to solve complex problems requiring critical thinking and consideration of multiple factors. The current implementation analyzes the potential impact of a Chinese price war on Thailand's economy through multiple analytical branches.

## üß† Understanding Tree of Thought

The Tree of Thought (ToT) methodology follows these key steps:

1. **Root Question**: Submit a complex problem to the LLM
2. **Branch Identification**: Break down the problem into relevant branches/factors
3. **Sub-branch Analysis**: Explore each branch with specialized prompting
4. **Integration**: Combine insights from all branches
5. **Conclusion**: Generate a comprehensive solution

## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
Claude_with_TOT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pycache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                  # Main execution script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt         # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tree_of_thought.py       # Core ToT implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project documentation
```

## üíª Implementation Details

The implementation consists of:

1. **Main Script** (`main.py`):
   - Sets up API authentication with Anthropic
   - Defines the root question about Chinese price war impacts
   - Configures model parameters (Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20240620, max tokens)
   - Creates branch and sub-branch structure
   - Processes and assembles the final response

2. **Branch Structure**:
   - **Domestic Market Competition**
     - Price Undercutting
     - Market Share Losses
     - Innovation and Quality Improvement
   - **Consumer Behavior**
     - Demand for Cheaper Goods
     - Disposable Income and Spending Patterns
     - Brand Loyalty and Perception

3. **Processing Flow**:
   - Each branch has specialized system instructions to analyze from specific perspectives
   - Sub-branches examine focused aspects within each branch domain
   - Branches are analyzed independently and then combined
   - Developer can manually remove sub-branches with unsatisfactory responses
   - Final conclusion synthesizes all insights into a comprehensive analysis

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.6
- Anthropic API Key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Claude_with_TOT.git
   cd Claude_with_TOT
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies in CMD:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Configure your API key:
Edit main.py and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Anthropic API key

##### Running the Analysis
Simply execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
## üìä How It Works

The implementation uses a structured approach where:

1. Each perspective function (like `domestic_market_competition`, `price_undercutting`, etc.) creates specific prompts for Claude
2. Each function includes custom system content to guide Claude's analysis from that particular perspective
3. The main script assembles all branch outputs into a final query
4. The `make_conclusion` function synthesizes all branches into a comprehensive analysis

## üîÑ Customization

The project is designed for easy adaptation to other complex analytical questions:

1. Modify the root question in `main.py`
2. Adjust branch functions in `tree_of_thought.py` to match your new question
3. Configure branch-specific prompts to guide Claude's specialized analysis
4. Adjust the final query assembly to include all relevant perspectives

## üìù Example Usage

This implementation analyzes Chinese price war impacts through perspectives like:
- Effects on Thai producers and small businesses
- Market share displacement by cheaper Chinese alternatives
- Need for innovation and quality improvement
- Shifts in consumer preferences and spending patterns
- Brand loyalty erosion for Thai products

## üîç Optimization Techniques

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Each branch uses carefully crafted system content
2. **Selective Branches**: Developer can manually include/exclude branches
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Configurable model name and token limits
4. **Structural Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between branches

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Dynamic branch generation based on initial query analysis
- Automated branch quality evaluation
- Interactive branch selection interface
- Visualization of the thought tree structure
- Support for multiple LLM providers
- And more possibilities to explore!
